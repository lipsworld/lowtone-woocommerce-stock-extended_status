# Extended Stock Status

This WordPress plugin provides an option to add additional information about the availability of products in WooCommerce.

When a product's stock status is set to "Out of stock" an option becomes available to define whether the product is unvailable because of it being discontinued or that the product will be available on short notice.

If the availability is set to "Expected" another option becomes available to set an optional date when the product is expected.
